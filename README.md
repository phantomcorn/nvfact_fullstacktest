## ✅ 1. Project Overview

I am using MERN stack for this project. The specifics details are:

- Backend framework used:  Express (NodeJS)
- Frontend framework used:  ReactJS + ThreeJS
- State management library:  Redux-Toolkit
- Authentication method:  JWT
- Deployment method (if any):  
- Database: MongoDB (mongoose library)

Different smart factory software for different clients may have different requirements therefore structure cannot be guaranteed hence the choice of noSQL database. This will also help with consistent workflow since we do not have to swap between different databases.
